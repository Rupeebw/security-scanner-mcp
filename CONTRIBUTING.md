## Adding New Security Patterns

To add new security patterns, edit `src/scanner.ts`:

```typescript
// Example: Adding a new API key pattern
{
  pattern: /new-api-key-pattern/gi,
  type: 'api-key',
  severity: 'high',
  message: 'Potential New API Key exposed'
}
```

### Pattern Guidelines
- Use case-insensitive regex when appropriate
- Avoid overly broad patterns that cause false positives
- Include clear, actionable messages
- Set appropriate severity levels:
  - `critical`: Immediate security risk
  - `high`: Significant vulnerability
  - `medium`: Potential issue
  - `low`: Best practice violation

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript
- Follow existing formatting (2 spaces, no semicolons where optional)
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test           # Run all tests
npm test -- --watch  # Watch mode
npm test -- --coverage  # With coverage
```

### Writing Tests
- Add tests for new features in `test/`
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Include edge cases

Example test:
```javascript
describe('SecurityScanner', () => {
  test('should detect AWS access keys', () => {
    const content = 'AKIA1234567890ABCDEF';
    const result = scanner.checkContent(content);
    expect(result.findings).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(result.findings[0].type).toBe('aws-access-key');
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Include examples for new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md (if exists)

## Pull Request Process

1. **PR Title**: Use conventional commit format
2. **Description**: Explain what and why
3. **Testing**: Describe how you tested
4. **Screenshots**: Include if UI/output changes
5. **Review**: Address feedback promptly
